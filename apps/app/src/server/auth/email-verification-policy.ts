/**
 * Email verification is a credential-account concern: only users who sign in
 * with an email + password pair must prove they own the address. Users
 * provisioned by an identity provider (generic OAuth today, atproto later)
 * are exempt — the provider vouches for their identity, and forcing
 * verification would lock them out of accounts they can already access.
 *
 * The exemption is materialized as `user.emailVerificationExempt` so the
 * per-request decision reads session state and never touches the database.
 * Exemption depends only on which account rows exist — never their contents —
 * so account creation is the sole event that can change it: the create hook
 * in ./index.tsx recomputes the flag, and post-migration 0048 backfills it.
 * Staleness always errs closed: the unhookable paths (account deletion) can
 * only leave a user non-exempt who could be exempt, never the reverse. That
 * guarantee leans on `account.accountLinking.allowUnlinkingAll` staying
 * unset — Better Auth then refuses to unlink a user's last account, so an
 * exempt user can never reach zero accounts while keeping a stale flag.

 * user row). If `session.cookieCache` is ever enabled, a cached cookie could
 * keep a stale `emailVerificationExempt: true` for the cache TTL after a
 * credential account is added — a fail-open window. Route this write through
